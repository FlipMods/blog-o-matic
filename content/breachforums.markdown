# FBI Seizes Notorious Cybercrime Forum BreachForums Once Again
The FBI in collaboration with an international coalition of law enforcement agencies, has successfully seized the notorious cybercrime forum BreachForums. This significant operation marks another critical step in the ongoing battle against cybercriminal activities and the underground forums that facilitate them.

## A Persistent Cybercrime Haven
BreachForums has long been recognized as a prominent English-language platform for hackers and cybercriminals. The forum has served as a marketplace where illicit actors advertise, sell, and trade stolen data. Notably, recent activities on the forum included the sale of Dell customers' personal information and data pilfered from a Europol portal.

Despite previous law enforcement actions, BreachForums has exhibited remarkable resilience. Last year, authorities managed to seize an earlier version of the site, following the arrest of its administrator, Conor Brian Fitzpatrick, known online as pompompurin. Subsequently, an individual using the alias Baphomet resurrected the forum, which operated under three different domains over the past year.

## Enhanced Law Enforcement Measures
In a departure from past seizures, this latest operation saw federal authorities extending their reach to BreachForums' associated Telegram channels. The FBI now controls the official Telegram channel of the forum and that of one of its administrators, Baphomet. These channels currently display an FBI message confirming the takeover and indicating that the agency is "reviewing the siteâ€™s backend data."

The FBI's message also invites individuals with information regarding cybercriminal activities on BreachForums to come forward, providing a dedicated website for tips and reports.

## Background and Context
From June 2023 until May 2024, BreachForums (accessible via breachforums.st, .cx, .is, and .vc) operated as a clear-net marketplace. The forum facilitated the exchange of contraband, including stolen access devices, means of identification, hacking tools, breached databases, and other illicit services. During this period, the forum was managed by an administrator known as ShinyHunters, who has not responded to requests for comment.

## Uncertainties and Speculations
It remains unclear how law enforcement authorities managed to seize control of the Telegram channels. One plausible scenario is the arrest of Baphomet, leading to the confiscation of his devices. However, Telegram spokesperson Remi Vaughn has confirmed that the company did not cooperate with law enforcement agencies in this takedown.

## Previous Administrator's Legal Troubles
Conor Brian Fitzpatrick, the former administrator of BreachForums, pleaded guilty to federal charges last July. His arrest and subsequent guilty plea were pivotal in the initial takedown of the forum, which underscores the relentless efforts by law enforcement to dismantle cybercriminal networks.

## Call to Action
The FBI's ongoing investigation into BreachForums is a testament to the agency's commitment to curbing cybercrime. The agency urges anyone with relevant information about activities on BreachForums to contact them through their dedicated website.

## Conclusion
The takedown of BreachForums by the FBI and international partners marks a significant victory in the fight against cybercrime. The forum's persistent operation and re-emergence underscore the challenges faced by law enforcement in combating digital criminal activities. This latest seizure, which includes the control of associated communication channels, demonstrates an escalated approach and a robust commitment to disrupting these illicit networks.

The collaborative efforts of global law enforcement agencies continue to play a crucial role in safeguarding cyberspace, ensuring that platforms like BreachForums are unable to provide safe havens for criminal enterprises. As investigations proceed, the full impact of this operation will likely unfold, offering further insights into the depth of cybercriminal activities facilitated by such forums.
